# Reading: Recycling Innovations – ANSWERS

## True / False / Not Given

1. Recycling robots are capable of differentiating between organic and inorganic materials. → **Not Given** (the text says "plastic, glass, and metal" but doesn't mention organic specifically)
2. Newer recycling robots perform better than humans in sorting various materials. → **True** ("robots can work faster and more accurately than humans")
3. Chemical recycling can recycle plastics that are difficult for traditional recycling methods. → **True** ("helps to recycle materials that were previously considered non-recyclable")
4. Anaerobic digestion of food waste does not contribute to electricity production. → **False** ("Biogas can be used for electricity")
5. Anaerobic digestion involves breaking down food waste in an open container. → **False** ("in a sealed tank")
6. Community education is part of the effort to improve recycling programs. → **True** ("They are educating people about recycling")
7. Communities are moving away from recycling programs due to the complexity of new technologies. → **False** ("communities are also improving their recycling programs")
8. Using biogas from food waste for vehicle fuel is the most common application of anaerobic digestion. → **Not Given** (vehicle fuel is mentioned but not as "most common")
9. Chemical recycling has been more expensive than traditional recycling methods. → **Not Given** (cost is not discussed)
10. Innovations in recycling technology show that creativity and effort can lead to better recycling methods. → **True** ("with creativity and effort, we can find better ways to recycle")
